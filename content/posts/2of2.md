## Shot out of the Week
*Highlighting the Crypto Art MVPs week after week.* Shot out of the week goes to :

[Ben Nolan](https://twitter.com/bnolan), the founder and creator of [Cryptovoxels](https://www.cryptovoxels.com/). Cryptovoxels is a VR world built on Ethereum where each piece of land is an NFT. He started off building this whole world and it flourished into the centerpiece of crypto art galleries and masterpiece buildings and so much more. For the sake of Crypto Art, it has become the place where every artist and collector can create and show off their art. Thanks to you when people ask, "but how do you show the art if its not physical?" We can say, "I show off my art in my gallery in a 3d world where even the land is a token on the blockchain."


# Crypto Art Caught Corona! 

There’s no doubt the Coronoavirus has wreaked havoc across the globe causing medical issues and scare, however, the crypto art industry has reacted fairly positively. Artists have surfaced a wide array of emotions through their artwork,  events have moved into VR, and artwork continues to sell. During this global wide shutdown there has been and will be a lot of time to reflect, and it's great that we can all share our thoughts and convene using new technologies and mediums that are embraced in this community.

## Coronavirus Themed Art
It feels like the majority of artwork made has been Corona themed which makes sense. Art and artists are expressing themselves and their styles through their artwork and its amazing. The crypto art world has seen the full spectrum of work. 

This artwork expresses the seriousness of Corona as tells a story of what it would feel like to have contracted the virus, with the creation of an MP4 with video and audio. [Mlibty](https://twitter.com/mlibty) created ["Viral madness"](https://superrare.co/artwork-v2/viral-madness-8630) The visuals are instense red colored and flaring up environments to the sound of a discomferting clicking and beat. Mlibity has a history of using the same shadow figures to express many different themes within his past work. Click [here](https://superrare.co/artwork-v2/viral-madness-8630) to see the artwork.

Another artwork brings out positivity when people need it most, through an MP4 with video and audio. ["Saddy Bel"](https://superrare.co/artwork-v2/saddy-bel-8810) created by [Hackatao](https://twitter.com/Hackatao) shows a woman swinging in peace and practically meditating to a uplifting and inspriging audio that makes you feel like everything will be alright. Hackatao detailed stenciling within Saddy and positively colorful backgrounds are recurring themes in his past works. Click [here](https://superrare.co/artwork-v2/saddy-bel-8810) to see the artwork.

This artwork takes the tough job of making fun with a bad situation, by having a satirical approach with a GIF. ["PANIC STATIONS"](https://superrare.co/artwork-v2/panic-stations-8803) created by [Xcopy](https://twitter.com/XCOPYART). This GIF shows someone on ther phone scrolling through an endless list of sould out toilet paper. Coming from Xcopy this is perfect because he's known for reflecting current events in his work and does an incredible job summing up the humor and fud of everyone rushing to stock up on toilet paper more than any other object. Click [here](https://superrare.co/artwork-v2/panic-stations-8803) to see the artwork.

## Crypto Art Meetups are Thriving

In a time when people cannot leave their homes hanging out with other people virtually is just what people need. It's just great timing for the crypto art space that we are already inside of VR worlds building crypto art gallery's people can visit, hosting events like art charity auctions, and just hanging out there in peoples free time. 

You can check out upcoming events in this newsletter a bit above. Instead of going in to detail of past events or upcoming events Ill point out where the platforms need to improve. It's already amazing what you can do in Cryptovoxel for instance, building on land, chatting with people through text or audio by just holding down a letter on your keyboard. The next step is to improve organizing and communication tools in VR. We should have imporved tooling around scheduling events, communication those events in virtual channels, and while at the events communicating as if we were in person. Zoom the communication software is one thread of conversation and presenting something is to everyone, whereas in real live situations some poeple can be chatting in groups by proximity and showing something that might not be presented to the entire room.

### Value in ETH vs. USD

Artwork is selling! but its selling for a bit less than usual, in terms of USD. However the amount of ETH for artists average sale rate has stayed pretty strong. For instance, a 13 ETH sale for the highest bid price of the week for Hackatao is above his average and on par with some of his most recent sales. However, thats when ETH was $200 - 300 USD. Now, ETH being at $120 its siginificantly less. But we hear from artists that its actually ok because they want to stock up on more ETH. 

Its not the same as physical art. In physical art there is a cost of materials. Of course there is still a cost of time but in a digital realm, artists want to trade their natively digital artwork for natively digital currency and see value in the ETH. That does go to show that the current space of artists are fairly bullinsh on ETH as an investment.

At the end of the day, how does it affect the collector? Collectors like to think in terms of USD when the price of an ETH is really high and like to think in terms of ETH when the price of an ETH is really low. It simple, if Im going to place a bid on an artwork when the price of ETH is high I want the USD price to get locked in while its high so if ETH ever goes down in value I've locked in the USD value on that artwork I own. Therefore, when I resell it on the secondary market I cand retain at least the USD value even though the ETH I spend on it is worth way less. On the other hand as a collector when I buy artwork when ETH price in USD is low, I want the resell to be thought of in terms of ETH because when that price of USD to ETH goes up I want it to be at least as valuable as the ETH I spent.

If the market is saying anything while this market we are in is dropping, its that people are thinking in terms of ETH. Depending on which way you look at it, it can be good or bad. As a collector I'd say it makes a crashing economy less attractive to art because ETH in the short term might be expected to outperform art at these ETH prices, so I'd rather hold ETH. At the same time there's just so much amamzing art being released! and of course once the price is high, if its the case poeple still think in terms of ETH then the price of the art holds at least the value of ETH + the incremental value of the art's appreciation. My concern is, will people continue to look at crypto art in terms of ETH demonimation when the price of ETH is high again?
