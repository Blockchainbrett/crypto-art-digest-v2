# Crypto Art Digest - Edition 1 of 1
 *Sunday, March 15th 2020*

Hey Crypo Art enthusiasts! Hope everyone is safe and healthy. Welcome to the Crypto Art Digest covering hot takes and updates in the crypto art space each week. Coverage includes SuperRare, Async.art, OpenSea, etc.. all the crypto art platforms. Since this is the first edition, it will include more than the past week.

## Bidding Wars 
*The historical crypto art bidding wars!*

Ranked below are the greatest bidding wars and highest sold Crypto Art of all time!
(See article at the bottom for details on each sale)

* [Celestial Cyber Dimension - Guilherme Twardowski](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/18/style/cryptokitty-auction.html) the "cryptokitty" sold for **$140k USD (Ethereal)** - Event

### Artsy Artists
*The crypto artists we know and love.. the people that make it all possible.*

This list is who I'd consider to be the greatest crypto artists in the space so far. This is a subjective view and, disclosure, I do own at least one piece of each artists (as well as many others). The next edition will be specific to art created that week.

* [Coldie](https://twitter.com/Coldie) - 3D Style and crypto themed art. A staple in the crypto art industry with more than 80 pieces created dating back to having one of the first pieces posted on SuperRare. His Decentral Eyes series on SuperRare includes key influencers to the decntralization movment. #GIFs #3D #MP4


## MVC's (Most Valuable Collectors)
*These collectors (some say "whales" or "squids") are the MVPs.* On the next newsletter it will be specific to art from that week. This one is a tribute to crypto art history. 

* [VK Crypto](https://SuperRare.co/vk_crypto) - The legendary first crypto art whale that made the first large purchases right at the beginning. Respect for being the first major whale to kick things off. He's known for his tweet to turn down the largest bidding war at that time on one of his pieces and Hackatao made an [art piece](https://SuperRare.co/artwork-v2/vk_crypto-said:-5353) just for that moment. Hasnt been as active more recently. Anonymous.

## Shot out of the Week
*Highlighting the Crypto Art MVPs week after week.* Our first and well deserve shout out goes too:

[Jonathan Perkins](https://twitter.com/jperkinsx?lang=en) is the founder of SuperRare, collector, and leader in the space. He started SuperRare when very few people were in the crypto art scene and it has flourished into the highest volume crypto art platform by far. It's where everyone knows to get 1 of 1 on chain crypto art with files stored on IPFS, decentralized storage. The platform has become the true stable of crypto art and without his conviction and hard work for the space (and from the SuperRare amazing team!) we for sure would not be where we are at today. Thanks JPerkins! *Catch his [curating crypto podcast](https://anchor.fm/curating-crypto/episodes/Jonathan-Perkins-A-musician--programmer--entrepreneur-and-co-founder-of-SuperRare-e592fe) or also bid on the [podcasts cover photo](https://superrare.co/artwork-v2/jonathan-perkins---episode-8-5351)*

# Crypto Art Bidding Wars Will Change Art History 

You might be familiar with the art auctions like the famous banksy auctioned at Sotheby’s that had known art collectors and brokers in one room, but have you heard about the CryptoArt bidding wars? These bidding wars are open to anyone, happen online, and with all sorts of auction formats. “Whales” or big spenders have elevated the value of the crypto art industry taking crypto artist from last year selling a 1 of 1 art piece for $100, to now selling new pieces for $10,000+ and some being listed on secondary markets for $50k - $150 k. Crypto art platforms take ditial art and tokenize them onto the ethereum blockchain which can then be traded over any platform. Even after the first sale, the royalties for the artist and the platform are baked into the token for secondary sales.

## Crypto Art Platforms

All of this incredible momentum in the crypto art space has been explosive. It could not have been done without our favorite software platforms that provide the crypto art experiences. Lets talk about some of the most popular ones and how they work.

### SuperRare.co
SuperRare is an easy to use and social driven crypto art creator/collector platform. 
* Art type: Only 1 of 1 art pieces
